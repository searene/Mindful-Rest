# RestTime

This is an app that can help you focus on your work/study and stop wasting your time on short videos, social media, etc. The idea is pretty simple:

1. Start: When you want to have a rest, let's say watch some entertaining videos on your phone, click on "start resting" in the app.
2. Stop: When you finish and want to go back to study/work, click on "stop".
   
As you can see, you record each of your rest manually, we call this kind of resting “Mindful Rest”. Although this is a simple idea, even seems stupid, it's based on countless studies on psychology, and you will see it for yourself after trying it for a day or two. I'll just point out some key important theories behind the app:

1. Longer Focus: Believe it or not, sometimes you don't even know you are picking up the phone and wandering about while studying/working, which is detrimental to your concentration. By clicking on a button before and after resting, you force yourself to be aware of it. In most of these situations, you will choose to continue to focus on your work and not waste your time.
2. Better Plan: When you are aware that the resting time is counting, you will make better decisions as to when you should have a rest, how long you should have a rest, etc.

Just try it! you will know how useful the app is.
